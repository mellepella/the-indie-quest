              The Indie Quest is a course in programming, art, and production,
              specifically designed for creating indie games. Instead of
              studying individual subjects in isolation, you acquire the skills
              directly by using them on game projects.
            </p>

                <p class="card-text">
                  You will first become an apprentice, completing carefully
                  designed game coding missions that will build your programming
                  knowledge step-by-step. You will then extend these foundations
                  by learning advanced concepts while creating your own games.
                  Applying project management strategies will help you prototype
                  your ideas and polish the end result to share your games with
                  the world.

              On the art side of things you will choose any visual style that
              you want for your games. A study plan personalized for your goals
              will guide you through the art fundamentals and technical aspects
              required to bring your vision to life. Be it pixel art, 3D,
              traditional drawing, or digital painting, we have you covered.

            <h3 class="card-md-header">The way we teach</h3>
            <p class="mt-3 card-text">
              There are no exams in our school. You will not have to write
              project reports or memorize theory. All that matters is what you
              are able to create and your completed games will demonstrate that.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              We use the flipped classroom model to make sure you get all the
              help you need to master your skills. Instead of listening to a
              teacher lecturing everyone at the same speed, you will use online
              educational materials to learn at your own pace. Some concepts
              might take longer to conquer, other times you will breeze ahead.
              The teacher will be there to answer any specific questions and
              help you individually when you need it.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              You will share an office space with other students and a teacher
              so you can learn and create in a supportive environment. Daily
              stand-up meetings will kick off the workday and weekly group
              check-ins will make sure everyone is reaching their goals.

                  Another unique advantage of The Indie Quest, besides the
                  specialized curriculum, is learning and working within a
                  community of many professional indie game developers.
                  Spelkollektivet, where the school takes place, is the largest
                  co-living and co-working space for game developers from all
                  over the world. You will be part of a friendly, supportive
                  community that shares the love for gaming and creating games,
                  including all the social and professional development
                  activities that happen in the house.
