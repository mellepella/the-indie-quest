              Our program is divided into 5 sections, intended to be covered in
              1 year of full-time study.
            </p>
            <h3 class="card-md-header mt-4">1. Preparation</h3>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              The Indie Quest requires no previous experience in programming.
              Through carefully designed missions, you will conquer the basics
              of programming by coding individual aspects of games. You will
              learn how computers work and touch on other aspects of computer
              science, such as computational thinking and algorithm design, so
              that you will have the foundation to tackle any programming
              problems thrown your way.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">Skills covered:</p>

            <h3 class="card-md-header mt-5">2. Text adventure</h3>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              It's time to design your first game. You will choose your own
              theme and write a text adventure with various locations,
              characters, and objects to manipulate. It's up to you what the
              goal of the game is. The project will be bigger than previous
              missions and require a more organized approach.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              Your next project is a simple, top-down, one-screen arcade game,
              such as a space shooter. You will take your coding knowledge and
              use it to learn game programming with the Unity game engine.

            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              Before we move on to more learning, you will participate in a
              72-hours game jam that will bring everyone at Spellkolektivet
              together to create games based around a shared theme. You could
              work alone or take the opportunity to team up, either with other
              students or join the rest of the developers from the house.
            </p>

            <h3 class="card-md-header mt-5">4. Platformer</h3>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              With basic game architecture knowledge under your belt, it's time
              to create a complex game that will use all the most common
              components you'll need in any game project. This will be the last
              guided project before starting your final game.

            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              The game you will graduate the program with will be completely up
              to you. It's time to put all you've learned into a polished
              product, optionally learning some advanced topics along the way.
              You can go at it alone, or join forces with another classmate or
              two.

            <h3 class="card-md-header mt-5">Tools and languages</h3>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              The concepts you will learn in the first two sections of the
              programming curriculum will be highly universal and applicable to
              any kind of programming tasks, in and outside video games.
              Sections 3-5 will be specific to game development, but giving you
              a high-level understanding of how games work that can be applied
              to any game type and approach.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              To make teaching practical however, we had to choose a specific
              programming language and game engine around which to organize the
              learning materials. We chose Unity since it is the most popular
              engine in indie game development and one you are most likely to
              encounter when trying to collaborate with other indie developers.
              Based on this decision, C# was the logical choice for the
              programming language.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text mt-4">
              While some of the concepts common in the gaming industry will not
              be covered due to this choice (for example, pointers and manual
              memory management), you will receive enough low-level knowledge
              about how computers work that you will not have problems moving to
              C or C++ if you choose to afterwards. Learning a specific
              programming language is not the hard part and a skilled programmer
              with understanding of general concepts has no problem switching
              and learning a new programming language. Similarly, moving from
              Unity to another engine will not be hard if you decide to do so.

              The art curriculum runs in parallel with programming and
              production and serves to create all the necessary art assets for
              the projects. You are required to learn the basics of raster and
              vector digital art production (2D or 3D), but beyond that, it's
              completely up to you what kind of art styles, mediums, and themes
              you want to explore. For each of the 4 main projects you will
              choose a goal and follow a personalized study plan that will lead
              you to creating all of the art.

              Similarly to how you will be free to choose your own art style,
              you will be able to choose the tools you want to make your art
              with, both digital and traditional. You will be responsible for
              obtaining your own software and hardware, but we made sure all the
              assignments can be completed with free software, a mouse, some
              paper, and a pencil. Any extra hardware (graphic tablets and
              displays, pens, art markers …) or paid software is optional and
              only required if you decide to pursue certain art styles. The
              school will have some art materials available, but if you have
              your own art supplies, definitely bring them along.
